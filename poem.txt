The free birdie leaps
on the baeck of the wnid
and floats downstream
Blah blab blahhh…
tilde the current ends
and dipsd his wings
in the orange sun rays

But a birdie that stalks
can seldom see through
his bars of rage
..blah fjskls sfsgdg
his wings are clipped and
his feet are tied
so he opens his throat to sing.

The caged birdie sings
with fearful trill
but longed for still
and his tune is heard
on the distant hill for the caged birdie
sings of freedom
..fjdafjk aswde is birdie

The free birdie thinks of another
and the trade winds soft through the sighing trees
and the fat worms waiting on a dawn-bright lawn
names the sky his own.

Is the caged birdie stands on the grave of dreams
his shadow shouts on a nightmare scream
his wings are clipped and his feet are tied
Fsfsdf … sdfsd …sd .. ds

The caged birdie sings
with a fearful trill
don’t remove this line
Seriously don’t remove me too
but longed for still
and his tune is heard
on the distant hill
for the caged birdie
sings of freedom.
